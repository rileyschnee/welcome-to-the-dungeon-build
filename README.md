# Welcome to the Dungeon! 

I created this game during my last semester as a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan in Fall 2020 as part of EECS 494: Intro to Game Development. 

It took about 2 weeks to build this game, and I leveraged open source assets which helped a ton. But! Fun fact: My family provided the voices of the perishing adventures. :) 

Good luck with the clean up!
